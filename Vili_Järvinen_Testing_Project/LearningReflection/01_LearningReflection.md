> Please use the below questions as guidelines to help you think and plan your Learning Reflection Report

## 1. How was your experience testing the given Webapp?
- Testing was easy and the app works pretty well I think
     

## 2. How did you write or manage your test case?
- I was given templates to basically just fill out with given tasks
    

## 3. Do you recommend any other tools or styles for Test case management, 
 - I have done some actual testing for work and to document the tests we used tracing of the software rather than writing it out ourselves. I feel like this saves a lot of time from the testers.


## 4. Which IDE (Visual Code or Atom or else) have you used to edit files?
- VS code


     
## 5. Did you find any trouble? how did you solve the trouble?
- After creating my account I could not verify it, because it was already verified... problem kinda solved itself I guess?


## 6. Did you find any trouble using Github? have you used Github before? where?
- I have never used GitLab before and to be honest I am still a bit unsure what it is used for, but I use GitHub daily to save my code and share it between my laptop and my PC
 

      

## 7. If in the future if you need to automate these test cases, which framework or language will you use? and describe why (Robot Framework, Cypress, Selenium, or any other )
- I dont think I will



## 8. Kindly search the term `Tester` `Automation Tester` glassdoor and LinkedIn or any other job search website. Currently, list the skills and competencies that are most in-demand in software testing
- Must be able to read, write and understand English.



## 9. **Let's assume** that if you are going to continue with the career in Software Testing, which technical and soft skills do you need to fill up the blank in your resume?
- I don't plan to only do testing as a job, but I rather use what I've learned on this course to help myself test software I develop




## 10. Write short Learning Reflection and  Free words Do you think that project helped in putting theoretical knowledge into practice? Describe? (is there anything else that you would like to share with us concerning the current study module). e.g. regarding the quality of content and your learning (or) improvement ideas? 
- I am sorry, but I do not think this last assignment was very useful. I am more interested in actually testing, debugging and fixing code. I do understand why this would very hard to implement in this course though.
I think I learned some really good ways of doing tests from the course material and some of the theory was really interesting. It is very hard to remember all the terms realted to testing as all of them are very similar.
